copy-to-yii-fixture
===================

A plug-in for Sequel Pro to copy tables into Yii/PHPUnit fixtures

This allows you to select a list of records in the Query or Table view,
and export them to the copy buffer as a PHP array (suitable for use in
Yii / PHPUnit fixtures).

It's a shameless ripoff of Hans-JÃ¶rg Bibiko's "Copy as JSON" bundle.
All credit goes to him, and any possible blame goes to me.
